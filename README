StatViz README

StatViz is hosted on SourceForge:

GETTING STARTED:
It's a pretty simple program to use... open up example.conf and customize it to your needs.

Then, to execute, simply:

statviz.php --config myconfig.conf

It will report its progress.

VIEWING OUTPUT
StatViz outputs DOT files. DOT files are text-based graph files that can be rendered by GraphViz.

GraphViz is a freely available software from:

http://graphviz.org/

There are viewers available on most major platforms.

NOTE
The software has not been heavily tested at this point. I have used it personally on a number of log files from 2-3 domains. The largest file I have analyzed is about 100,000 lines. Because of the nature of the analysis, you don't really need much more than a small period of time (1 week to 1 month depending on traffic) to get a good picture of the aggregate clickstream analysis.

StatViz isn't trying to compete with other log analyzers that show histograms and averages of hits, there are plenty of good solutions already for that need.
